# Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Project
##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior using Power BI. The objective is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and provide actionable insights to help businesses improve customer retention, revenue stability, and service quality.
The analysis is performed on a telecom customer dataset containing 7,043 customers and 21 attributes, covering demographics, services, contract details, payment behavior, and churn status.

## Business Objectives
- Understand why customers churn
- Identify high-risk customer segments
- Analyze the impact of contracts, services, and payment methods
- Track key KPIs related to churn and customer lifetime
- Enable data-driven retention strategies

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation
- DAX – Measures & calculated columns
- CSV Dataset (Customer Churn)

 ## Dataset Description

- Standardized categorical values
- Optimized data model for performance

## Key KPIs Created
- Total Customers
- Churned Customers
- Churn Rate (%)
- Average Monthly Charges
- Average Tenure
- Total Revenue
- Revenue Lost Due to Churn

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate
- Customers with fiber optic internet churn more than DSL users
